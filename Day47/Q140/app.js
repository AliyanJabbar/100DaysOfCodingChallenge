// Question 140: Explain the error that occurs when trying to use a reserved word as a variable name.
// Explain & TIP: Attempting to use a reserved word as a variable name will cause a syntax error in JavaScript. This is because reserved words have predefined meanings and uses in the language syntax.
// let function = "myFunc" //this line will cause error because we are using a reserved keyword "function" as a name of a variable 
console.log("trying to use javascript reserved keywords as a name e.g: name of a function, name of a variable, will definitely cause syntax error because these keywords are reserved and have a seperate meaning");
// we should not use javascript reserved keywords as names to avoid syntax errors
