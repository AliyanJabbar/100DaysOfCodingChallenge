// Question 79: Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing a car with properties for make, model, and year. Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.

let car = {
  make: "Audi",
  model: "e-tron GT",
  year: 2023
};
console.log(car.model); //by using .model we can access the model property of the car
// We use dot notation (car.model) to get the model of the car from our object.
