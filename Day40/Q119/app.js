// Question 119: Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.
// Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true. Itâ€™s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.
var num = 0;
var message = "Hello World";
while (num < 5) {
    console.log(message);
    num++;
}
