// Question 65: Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.



// This function finds the leftover of dividing two numbers
function Remainder (n1: number, n2:number):number{
    return n1 % n2 // here % is for finding the remainder
}

console.log(Remainder(11 , 5)) // here remainder is 1, and it is showing 1
// This tells us the leftover, which is 1 here.
